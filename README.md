# INTRODUCTION

This is the "Day-in-the-Life" demo for prospects new to Greenplum/MPP database. 

Its most effective when executed on a 1/4 rack DCA.  This is designed to be easily portable/re-creatable so demos can be spun-up quickly

1. The premise is to showcase how GPDB can address day-to-day tasks performed in typical DW/BI environments.  
2. This demo is most effective when put on a live DCA.  The data volumes should be big enough to make an SMP database struggle but small enough to have queries complete quickly.
3. Target audience includes DBA, BI team, Analysts,  heavy influencers.  
4. Designed for a 2.5 hour meeting.
5. This is an evolving script.
6. The accompanying .ppt is used to introduce each section.  The .ppt includes animated slides for those new to MPP
7. USE THE gpdemo-dwbi.sql SCRIPT TO EXECUTE THE STEPS IN THE DEMO.
